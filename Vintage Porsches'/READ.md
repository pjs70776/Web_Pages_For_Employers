# Live Project

# Introduction
For the last two weeks of my time at The Tech Academy, I worked with my peers in an Agile/Scrum environment.  The goal was to develop a fully functional webpage about a product that was of interest; I chose a classic car dealership.  The languages I used were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Bootstrap used to improve my time management and overall design ideas.  Working on a team and getting practical experience in a simulated work environment was extremely rewarding to see and be a part of.

# HTML
My HTML portion included a Navbar, and sections such as: Home, About Us (which included an image carousel), and a Gallery (for vehicles currently available for sale).  In addition, I included a 'return to top' button for ease of navigation, as well as a functional Subscribe/Contact pop out box.  Below, you will find a sample of my code that has created the button trigger modal and the components required to create the Subscirbe box.

# CSS
My CSS section includes all of the basic styling elements for generic styles for font (h1, h2, etc.), the home section layout, container/gallery styles, as well as the contact form syles. What you are seeing below is my code written to stylize the contact form.

# JavaScript
In my JavaScript section, I made the webpage even more sytlized.  Keeping the current year updated in the footer was one element.  Giving the modal element (the return to top button) fucnitonality, such as going to the top of the document was also added.  Lastly, allowing the viewer to toggle a dark mode for the page was inserted. In this image, you can see the modal and dark mode elements.
